ChipEmu README

What is ChipEmu?
ChipEmu is a public project to program and emulate various chips for research and development of software.
The project is aimed to accurately emulate the chips to function as a processor for programming.
This project also contains tools for programming on each chip to be optimized for quality, speed, and size (in that order).

What is the Project Plan:
Versioning will start off at 0.0.0 (codenamed "Public Beta") with a x.y.z versioning pattern, with 'x' from 0 on, while 'y' and 'z' run from 0-9.

0.0.0 "Public Beta" Project Plan:*
Chips to Emulate (Run Software On)
Introduce emulation through the Intel 8086 Chip (with the 5MHz Frequency)
Introduce emulation through the Intel 8086-1 Chip (with the 10MHz Frequency)
Introduce emulation through the Motorola MC6845 Chip (with the 1MHz Frequency)
Introduce emulation through the Motorola MC68A45 Chip (with the 1.5MHz Frequency)
Introduce emulation through the Texas Instruments TMS9918 Chip (with the 60Hz Frequency)
Chips to Emulate (Peripherals)
Introduce video emulation through the Texas Instruments TMS9918 Chip (Driver: tm9918_video)
ChipEmu C Compiler (Compile C Code)
Compile for the Intel 8086 Chip
Compile for the Motorola MC6845 Chip
char, int, long, double, and long long datatypes
#include and #define preprocessor commands
Standard C Library (libc)
fclose, fgetc, fopen, fseek, getchar, putc, rename, setbuf, and sscanf functions (stdio.h header)
stderr, stdin, and stdout variables (stdio.h header)
clock_t, dev_t, mode_t, pid_t, and size_t datatypes (sys/types.h header)
ChipEmu C++ Compiler (Compile C++ Code)
void, char, long, int, signed, signed char, unsigned, unsigned char, class, struct, namespace, and long int datatypes
Standard C++ Library (libcpp)
std::basic_string, std:wstring, and std:u16string classes (string header)
*This is what is remaining before version 0.0.0 can be released.
