ChipDev Standard C Library
--------------------------

The Purpose of the Standard C Library is to build a library for the ChipDev C Compiler that would support many programming standards and many extensions to the C programming language.

Standards:
These are the standards we are aiming to support.
ISO/IEC 9593-4:1991 (PHIGS91)
ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (C99)
ISO/IEC 9899:2011 (C11)
ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2009 (POSIX09)

Keywords (Defined in ../chipslibc/README)

Headers:
These are the files to include for definitions.
assert.h
complex.h
limits.h
locale.h
signal.h
stdbool.h
stddef.h
stdint.h
stdio.h
string.h
sys/types.h
uchar.h
wchar.h

Functions:
These are the functions in the library.
printf (stdio.h) - Prints formastted output to stdout, a file stream, or a buffer
strlen (string.h) - Returns the length of a given string

Macros:
These are the macros in the library.
bool (stdbool.h) - Convenience Macro that expands to _Bool
CHAR_BIT (limits.h) - Number of bits in a byte
LC_CTYPE (locale.h) - Locale Category for the setlocale function
NULL (stddef.h) - Null pointer constant

Typedefs:
These are the types defined in the library.
gid_t (sys/types.h) - Used for Group IDs
size_t (stddef.h; sys/types.h) - Used for Sizes of Objects

Structs:
These are the structures defined in the library.
lconv (locale.h) - Formatting details that are returned by localeconv
-> mon_grouping - A string whose elements indicate the sizes of digit groups
